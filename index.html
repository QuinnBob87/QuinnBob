 <p>This is my blog for my senior capstone project. I am currently working with Ryan and our goal is to make an ai to run games.<br>
  The first game we will do is connect 4, because of its limited player options and 2-d grid.<br>
  For ai in video games there are 3 ways for it to collect data. The first is the ai would read the code of the game, gaining all information.<br>
  The 2nd is to manually it enter the information. The third is for the ai to examine the screen and be able to read the screen. We want to do the third option.<br>
  After this we will have to have the ai analyze the board to determine which one of the up to 7 options is the best.<br>
  Finally, we will have the ai be able to input the move.<br>
  Problem Statement:<br> Strategy games such as chess are constantly evolving. In 1977 IBM's Deep Blue beat world chess champion, Gary Kasparov.<>
  Gary Kasparov was at the time the greatest chess player with no man better than him. After this victory, chess engines further developed, creating results humans could no lonmger repricate.<br>
  Today, chess engines can be used to determine strength in positions and creating intricate strategies.<br>
  With the help advanced chess ais, humanity is able to produce greater chess prodigies, and chess game evaluations are more accessible than ever.
  <br>
  Solution Statement: By advanicng artifical intelligince software using machine learning we are able to achieve the most meta ways on how to play strategical games.<br></p>

  The most difficult taks will be creating a score system. This system is crucial to the strength of our ai. In chess, ai can determine who is winning and values the score according to position and material<br>
  We will be doing this in connect 4 by reviewing games of connect 4 and creating a score based on position of pieces. Having a score system is crucial, because our ai will uise this to foretell the future moves to obtain a game state that is advantagous.
