<p>This is my blog for my senior capstone project. I am currently working with Ryan and our goal is to make an ai to run games.<br>
  The first game we will do is connect 4, because of its limited player options and 2-d grid.<br>
  For ai in video games there are 3 ways for it to collect data. The first is the ai would read the code of the game, gaining all information.<br>
  The 2nd is to manually it enter the information. The third is for the ai to examine the screen and be able to read the screen. We want to do the third option.<br>
  After this we will have to have the ai analyze the board to determine which one of the up to 7 options is the best.<br>
  Finally, we will have the ai be able to input the move.</p>
